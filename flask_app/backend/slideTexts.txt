Perimeter and area
What are we going to do today?Learn what a perimeter is and calculate the perimeter of different shapesLearn how we define and calculate areasLearn general area formulas for different shapesMake a poster of everything we have learnt in the past few weeks
What is perimeter?
The perimeter is the distance around the edge of a shape. 4 m4 m4 m3 m6 m6 m3 m2 m2 m2 m2 m2  m
The perimeter is the distance around the edge of a shape. 4 m4 m4 m3 m6 m6 m3 m2 m2 m2 m2 m2  m4 + 4 +4 = 12 m
The perimeter is the distance around the edge of a shape. 4 m4 m4 m3 m6 m6 m3 m2 m2 m2 m2 m2  m4 + 4 + 4 = 12 m6 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 18 m
The perimeter is the distance around the edge of a shape. 4 m4 m4 m3 m6 m6 m3 m2 m2 m2 m2 m2  m4 + 4 + 4 = 12 m6 + 3 + 6 + 3 = 18 m2 x 5 = 10 m
What would be the perimeter of this shape?8 mm 10 mm 5 mm 6 mm 
What would be the perimeter of this shape?8 mm 10 mm 5 mm 6 mm 10 + 6 = 16  mm 
What would be the perimeter of this shape?8 mm 10 mm 5 mm 6 mm 16  mm 8 - 5 = 3 mm 
What would be the perimeter of this shape?8 mm 10 mm 5 mm 6 mm 16  mm  3 mm 8 mm Perimeter = 10 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 16 + 8 =  48 mm 
What is area?
Area is the size of a surface. This is the amount of space inside the boundaries of a shape. 
We can find the area of different shapes by counting squares! If each square has a side length of 1 cm, whats the area of each of the shapes?
What is the perimeter of this shape?And the area?
To calculate the perimeter, we count the squares around the edges of the shape. 
To calculate the area, we can count the number of squares inside the shape. 
We have 4 unit squares in each row, and we have 4 rows in total. 
We have 4 unit squares in each row, and we have 4 rows in total. Then the area of the square is           4 x 4 = 16 units2
We can find the area of squares and rectangles by multiplying side-lengths. We use the formula below:Area = length x width What is the area of the shapes above?4 cm4 cm8 cm
Area = length x width Area = 4 x 4 = 16 cm24 cm8 cm4 cmArea = 4 x 8 = 32 cm2
Can you figure out what the formula would be for a triangle?
Area of a triangle = (base x height)  / 2
Area = (4 * 5 )/ 2  = 20 / 2   = 10 cm2 4 cm5 cm
We can apply area and perimeter to solve problems...Isabella is making a display board for the school trip. The display board is a 50 cm by 20 cm rectangle. She needs to add a ribbon border around the entire display board. What is the length of ribbon that she needs?
